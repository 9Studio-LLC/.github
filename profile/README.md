# Welcome to 9Studio's "Offices" here at GitHub!

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
-->
## So what's 9Studio?  
[We mainly make games](https://missingpro.itch.io/), but recently we published [X](https://github.com/9Studio-LLC/XTools), a simple programming language that is intended solely to git the basic tasks done (git it?).
## How can we, the community, contribute?
We are working towards making our stuff ***OPEN-SOURCE*** (yay!) which will hopefully allow the community to help out with our projects. You can also help us out by pointing out bugs or features that have valid reason to get added!
### What resources could we use? Is there anything else we need to know?
XMan is the manual for X included in XTools. As per the games, their instructions are usually on their itch.io pages.  
  
Please note that most of 9Studio's software is licensed under [9License](https://missingstudios.blogspot.com/p/9license.html), specifically version 10.0.0. You should carefully read the license before doing things with our software other than just using it.
# Thanks for reading this little introduction! :D
